### *[AnalysesSpatial_Mod_Val_Map_20190612.R](../SpatialAnalysis/AnalysesSpatial_Mod_Val_Map_20190612.R)*
- Last run: 6/21/2019
1. Notes: Spatial patterns, mean annual values
   - Temperature variables vs elevation, TPI*, CI, albedo, LAI, MAP, cloud freq, wind speed
   - Take station month year data and station annual data: complete years (so as to not bias dataset)
   - Analyze station mean annual AND mean month for (2006-2017 period)
   - Make scatterplot matrix of station mean annual Tmax, Tmin, Tavg, and DTR versus all covariates

2. Notes: Model selection and validation
   - Select best model for annual station-years looking at first order effects of all variable combinations
   - Perform k-fold cross validation to calculate MAE, RMSE for mean annual predictions from best models
   - produce FIGURE 2: Validation Stats of best models

3. Notes: Mapping
   - fit annual, monthly, and month year model coefficients based on best models from annual station-years
   - predict and make maps
